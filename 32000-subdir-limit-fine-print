ext4: Add fine print for the 32000 subdirectory limit

Some poeple are reading the ext4 feature list too literally and create
dubious test cases involving very long filenames and 1k blocksize and
then complain when they run into an htree-imposed limit.  So add fine
print to the "fix 32000 subdirectory limit" ext4 feature.
