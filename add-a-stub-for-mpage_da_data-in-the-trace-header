ext4: Add a stub for mpage_da_data in the trace header

From: Josh Stone <jistone@redhat.com>

The tracepoint ext4_da_write_pages has a struct mpage_da_data*
parameter, but that struct is only defined in fs/ext4/ext4.h.  This
patch adds a forward declaration for that struct, so this tracepoint
header can still be used by tools like SystemTap.

This is a continuation of the fix in commit 3661d286.
