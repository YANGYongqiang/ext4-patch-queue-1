fs-writeback: Add helper function to start writeback if idle

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

ext4, at least, would like to start pushing on writeback if it starts
to get close to ENOSPC when reserving worst-case blocks for delalloc
writes.  Writing out delalloc data will convert those worst-case
predictions into usually smaller actual usage, freeing up space
before we hit ENOSPC based on this speculation.

Thanks to Jens for the suggestion for the helper function,
& the naming help.

I've made the helper return status on whether writeback was
started even though I don't plan to use it in the ext4 patch;
it seems like it would be potentially useful to test this
in some cases.
