fs: build fix when !CONFIG_BLOCK

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

Today's -tip fails to build on !CONFIG_BLOCK, due to upstream commit
367a51a ("fs: Add FITRIM ioctl"):

 include/linux/fs.h:36: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘uint64_t’
 include/linux/fs.h:36: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘uint64_t’
 include/linux/fs.h:36: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘uint64_t’

The commit adds uint64_t type usage to fs.h, but linux/types.h is not
included explicitly - it's only included implicitly via
linux/blk_types.h, and there only if CONFIG_BLOCK is enabled.

Add the explicit #include to fix this.
