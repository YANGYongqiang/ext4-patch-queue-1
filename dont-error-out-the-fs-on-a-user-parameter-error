ext4: Don't error out the fs if the user tries to make a file too big

If the user attempts to make a non-extent-mapped file to be too large,
return EFBIG, but don't call ext4_std_err() which will end up marking
the file system as containing an error.

Thanks to Toshiyuki Okajima-san at Fujitsu for pointing this out.
