ext4: error handling fix in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized()

From: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>

When allocated is unsigned it breaks the error handling at the end
of the function when we call:
	allocated = ext4_split_extent(...);
	if (allocated < 0)
		err = allocated;

I've made it a signed int instead of unsigned.

You guys know I'm not an ext4 expert.  I can't swear that the math
all works correctly with a signed int.  I'm pretty sure it does, but
please review this carefully.
