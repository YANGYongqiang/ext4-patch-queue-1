ext4: Add feature set check helper for mount & remount paths

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

A user reported that although his root ext4 filesystem was mounting
fine, other filesystems would not mount, with the:

"Filesystem with huge files cannot be mounted RDWR without CONFIG_LBDAF"

error on his 32-bit box built without CONFIG_LBDAF.  This is because
the test at mount time for this situation was not being re-checked
on remount, and the normal boot process makes an ro->rw transition,
so this was being missed.

Refactor to make a common helper function to test the filesystem
features against the type of mount request (RO vs. RW) so that we 
stay consistent.

Addresses Red-Hat-Bugzilla: #517650
