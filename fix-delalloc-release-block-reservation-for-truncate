Ext4: Fix delalloc release block reservation for truncate

From: Mingming Cao <cmm@us.ibm.com>

Ext4 will release the reserved blocks for delayed allocations when
inode is truncated/unlinked.  If there is no reserved block at all, we
shouldn't need to do so.  But current code still tries to release the
reserved blocks regardless whether the counters's value is 0.
Continue to do that causes the later calculation to go wrong and a
kernel BUG_ON() caught that. This doesn't happen for extent-based
files, as the calculation for 0 reserved blocks was right for extent
based file.

This patch fixed the kernel BUG() due to above reason.  It adds checks
for 0 to avoid unnecessary release and fix calculation for non extent
files.
