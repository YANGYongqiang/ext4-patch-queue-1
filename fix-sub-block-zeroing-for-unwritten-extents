ext4: Fix sub-block zeroing for writes into preallocated extents

From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

We need to mark the buffer_head mapping preallocated space as new
during write_begin. Otherwise we don't zero out the page cache content
properly for a partial write. This will cause file corruption with
preallocation.

Now that we mark the buffer_head new we also need to have a valid
buffer_head blocknr so that unmap_underlying_metadata() unmaps the
correct block.
