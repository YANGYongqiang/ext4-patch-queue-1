ext4: Add i_version_hi field for ext4_inode

From: Kalpak Shah <kalpak@clusterfs.com>

This patch adds a 32-bit i_version_hi field to ext4_inode,
which can be used for 64-bit inode versions. This field will
store the higher 32 bits of the version, while Jean Noel's patch
has added support to store the lower 32-bits in osd1.linux1.l_i_version.
