ext4: Initialize fsync transaction ids in ext4_new_inode()

When allocating a new inode, we need to make sure i_sync_tid and
i_datasync_tid are initialized.  Otherwise, one or both of these two
values could be left initialized to zero, which could potentially
result in BUG_ON in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction.

(This could happen by having journal->commit_request getting set to
zero, which could wake up the kjournald process even though there is
no running transaction, which then causes a BUG_ON via the 
J_ASSERT(j_ruinning_transaction != NULL) statement.
