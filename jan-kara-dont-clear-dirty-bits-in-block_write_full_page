fs: Don't clear dirty bits in block_write_full_page()

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

NOTE: Added (from 9/11) of Jan Kara's patch series for testing only

If getblock() fails in block_write_full_page(), we don't want to clear
dirty bits on buffers. Actually, we even want to redirty the page. This
way we just won't silently discard users data (written e.g. through mmap)
in case of ENOSPC, EDQUOT, EIO or other write error (which may be just
transient e.g. because we have to commit a transaction to free up some space).
The downside of this approach is that if the error is persistent we have this
page pinned in memory forever and if there are lots of such pages, we can bring
the machine OOM.

We also don't want to clear dirty bits from buffers above i_size because that
is a generally a bussiness of invalidatepage where filesystem might want to do
some additional work. If we clear dirty bits already in block_write_full_page,
memory reclaim can reap the page before invalidatepage is called on the page
and thus confusing the filesystem.
