jbd: Fix jbd_commit_transaction()/journal_try_to_drop_buffers() race

From: Mingming Cao <cmm@us.ibm.com>

There are a few cases direct IO could race with kjournal flushing
data buffers which could result direct IO return EIO error.

1) journal_submit_data_buffers() tries to get bh_state lock. If
try lock fails, it drops the j_list_lock and sleeps for
bh_state lock, while holding a reference on the buffer.
In the meanwhile, journal_try_to_free_buffers() can clean up the
journal head could call try_to_free_buffers(). try_to_free_buffers()
would fail due to the reference held by journal_submit_data_buffers()
- which in turn causes failues for DIO (invalidate_inode_pages2()).

2) When the buffer is on t_locked_list waiting for IO to finish,
we hold a reference and give up the cpu, if we can't get
bh_state lock. This causes try_to_free_buffers() to fail.

3) when journal_submit_data_buffers() saw the buffer is dirty but failed
to lock the buffer bh1, journal_submit_data_buffers() released the
j_list_lock and submit other buffers collected from previous check, with
the reference to bh1 still hold. During this time
journal_try_to_free_buffers() could clean up the journal head of bh1 and
remove it from the t_syncdata_list. Then try_to_free_buffers() would
fail because the reference held by journal_submit_data_buffers()

4) journal_submit_data_buffers() already removed the jh from the bh
(when found the buffers are already being synced), but still keep a
reference to the buffer head. journal_try_to_free_buffers() could be
called. In that case try_to_free_buffers() will be called since there is
no jh related to this buffer, and failed due to
journal_submit_data_buffers() hasn't finish the cleanup business yet.

Fix for first three races is to drop the reference on the buffer head
 when release the j_list_lock,
give up the cpu and re-try the whole operation. 

This patch also fixes the race that data buffers has been
flushed to disk and journal head is cleard
by journal_submit_data_buffers() but did not get a chance to release
 buffer head reference before the journal_try_to_free_buffers() kicked in.
