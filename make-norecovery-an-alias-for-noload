ext4: make "norecovery" an alias for "noload"

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

Users on the linux-ext4 list recently complained about differences
across filesystems w.r.t. how to mount without a journal replay.

In the discussion it was noted that xfs's "norecovery" option is
perhaps more descriptively accurate than "noload," so let's make
that an alias for ext4.

Also show this status in /proc/mounts
