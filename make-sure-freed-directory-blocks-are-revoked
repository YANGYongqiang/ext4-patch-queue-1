ext4: directory blocks must be treated as metadata by ext4_forget()

When a directory gets unlinked, ext4_forget() is called on any buffer
heads corresponding to its data blocks.  Data blocks from directories
must be treated as metadata, so that they are revoked by
jbd2_journal_revoke, and not just forgotten via ext4_journal_forget().

Thanks to Curt Wohlgemuth for pointing out potential problems in this
area.
