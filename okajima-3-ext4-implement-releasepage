ext4: provide function to release metadata pages under memory pressure

From: Toshiyuki Okajima <toshi.okajima@jp.fujitsu.com>

Pages in the page cache belonging to ext4 data files are released via
the ext4_releasepage() function specified in the ext4 inode's
address_space_ops.  However, metadata blocks (such as indirect blocks,
directory blocks, etc) are managed via the block device
address_space_ops, and they can not be released by
try_to_free_buffers() if they have a journal head attached to them.

To address this, we supply a release_metadata function which calls
jbd2_journal_try_to_free_buffers() function to free the metadata, and
which is called by the block device's blkdev_releasepage() function.
