ext4: Remove unneeded BUG_ON() in ext4_move_extents()

From: Akira Fujita <a-fujita@rs.jp.nec.com>

The ext4_move_extents() functions checks with BUG_ON() whether the
exchanged blocks count accords with request blocks count.  But, if the
target range (orig_start + len) includes sparse block(s), 'moved_len'
(exchanged blocks count) does not agree with 'len' (request blocks
count), since sparse block is not counted in 'moved_len'.  This causes
us to hit the BUG_ON(), even though the function succeeded.
