# New delayed allocation patch
#
# Note: we still need to improve quota handling; at the moment, if the
# user goes over quota, the block is not allocated and the page is left
# dirty in the page cache.  This will prevent the filesystem from being
# mounted, and if the system crashes, the user's data will be lost without
# warning.  This is doubleplusungood!!
#
# Another major (and related) problem is that i_blocks is not getting
# updated until the disks are actually allocaed on disk.  This means
# that right after files are copied, "ls -sF" shoes the file as taking
# 0 blocks on disk.  "du" also shows the files taking zero space, which 
# is highly confusing to the user.
#
# A quick way of fixing this is to keep a count of blocks that are
# subject to delayed allocation, and use that to adjust the value returned 
# by stat(2).
#
# XXX does "df do the right thing with blocks not yet allocated?
