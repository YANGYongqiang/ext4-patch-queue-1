ext4: tidy up a void argument in inode.c

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

This doesn't fix anything at all, it just removes a vestige
of prior use from __mpage_da_writepage()

__mpage_da_writepage() had a *void argument leftover from
its previous life as a callback; make it reflect the actual type.

Fixing this up makes it slightly more obvious to read, and 
enables proper typechecking.

Ted, I had a similar change for mpage_put_bnr_to_bhs
which takes an mpd but only wants an inode, but you
absorbed that function in your patch series, so I didn't
submit the change here.
