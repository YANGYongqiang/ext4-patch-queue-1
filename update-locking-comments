+ * Locking rules:
+ * We keep two hash tables of revoke records. One hashtable belongs to the
+ * running transaction (is pointed to by journal->j_revoke), the other one
+ * belongs to the committing transaction. Accesses to the second hash table
+ * happen only from the kjournald and no other thread touches this table.  Also
+ * journal_switch_revoke_table() which switches which hashtable belongs to the
+ * running and which to the committing transaction is called only from
+ * kjournald. Therefore we need no locks when accessing the hashtable belonging
+ * to the committing transaction.
+ *
+ * All users operating on the hash table belonging to the running transaction
+ * have a handle to the transaction. Therefore they are safe from kjournald
+ * switching hash tables under them. For operations on the lists of entries in
+ * the hash table j_revoke_lock is used.
+ *
+ * Finally, also replay code uses the hash tables but at this moment noone else
+ * can touch them (filesystem isn't mounted yet) and hence no locking is
+ * needed.
