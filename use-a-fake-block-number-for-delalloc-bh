ext4: Use a fake block number for delayed new buffer_head

From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

Use a very large unsigned number (~0xffff) as as the fake block number
for the delayed new buffer. The VFS should never try to write out this
number, but if it does, this will make it obvious.
